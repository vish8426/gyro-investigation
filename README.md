Vibrations Labratory Investigation - Engineering Dynamics

## About
Vibrations can be divided into two different categories, forced and free vibrations. Forced vibrations are the result of external forces acting on a system. Free vibrations are oscillations in which the total energy is constant over time. During the laboratory session, three main investigations took place within the experiment: 
- Calculating the Spring Constant
- Free Vibrations
- Forced Vibrations
